# Solow-Growth-Model-Implementation
Explanation:

Developed a basic implementation of the Solow Growth Model to analyze long-term economic growth. The model uses parameters such as the capital share of output (α), depreciation rate (δ), savings rate (s), population growth rate (n), and technological growth rate (g). By iterating over a specified number of time periods (T), the model computes the evolution of capital per worker (k), output per worker (y), and consumption per worker (c). The results are visualized using a line plot to demonstrate the dynamics of the economy over time.

Key Features:
Capital Share of Output (α): Represents the contribution of capital to the production process.

Depreciation Rate (δ): Indicates the rate at which capital depreciates over time.

Savings Rate (s): Proportion of output saved and invested.

Population Growth Rate (n): Rate at which the labor force grows.

Technological Growth Rate (g): Rate at which technology improves.

Time Periods (T): Number of periods over which the model is simulated.
